Concept Overview
What is an Array?
	An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential
	 collection of elements of the same type.Key Points About Arrays:


	Arrays are zero-indexed.

	The size of an array is fixed and cannot be altered once declared.
	
	The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

---------------------------------------------------------
Declaration and Initialization:

		int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declaration with size
		int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Declaration with values
